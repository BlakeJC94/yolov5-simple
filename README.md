This repos is intended to be an educational tool for understanding the architecture of YOLOv5 by
[Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).


## TODO

- [X] Translate yaml parser and model into pytorch code
- [ ] Add option for loading pretrained weights
- [ ] Implement loss function
- [ ] Implement thin pytorch lighting wrapper for training
- [ ] Implement data and label transforms
- [ ] Reproduce results on COCO dataset
- [ ] Write "Usage" section in readme
